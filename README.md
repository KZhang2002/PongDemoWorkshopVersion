# PongDemoWorkshopVersion
The workshop version of my pong demo. To use these files, just extract the zip into a folder and open that folder using Unity. Then, open SampleScene in the scene folder.

A guide for this demo can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17wH_65lJJD9IfhDBnlSRuh3cHBO4T6YeGjKyuIVOeGc/edit?usp=sharing
